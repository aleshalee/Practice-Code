# Practice-Code
a README file as a guide that gives users a detailed description of a project you have worked on.
documentation with guidelines on how to use a project
Usually it will have instructions on how to install and run the project.

A guide for developers to understand and use my code.

It is the first file a person will see when they encounter your project, so it should be fairly brief but detailed

It will make your project standout from a bunch of others. Also be sure your project is good too.

It will help you focus on what your project needs to deliver and how.

When you're writing your project's README, it should be able to answer the what, why, and the how of the project.

Here are some guide questions that will help you out:

What was your motivation?
Why did you build this project?
What problem does it solve?
What did you learn?
What makes your project stand out?
If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.

Components:
Title- It describes the whole project in one sentence, and helps people understand what the main goal and aim of the project is.

Description- Your description is an extremely important aspect of your project. A well-crafted description allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.
The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase: 
  What your application does,
  Why you used the technologies you used,
  Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

Table of Contents - usually optional If your README is very long, you might want to add a table of contents to make it easy for users to navigate to different sections easily. It will make it easier for readers to move around the project with ease.

Installation Steps- Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.

Instructions and examples - This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.
You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.
Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

Credits - If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too. Also, if you followed tutorials or referenced a certain material that might help the user to build that particular project, include links to those here as well.

Add a Lisence - For most README files, this is usually considered the last part. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.

We have different types of licenses depending on the kind of project you are working on. Depending on the one you will choose it will determine the contributions your project gets.

The most common one is the GPL License which allows other to make modification to your code and use it for commercial purposes. If you need help choosing a license, use check out this link: https://choosealicense.com/

ADD ONS- other items that can be considered based on the case are

Badges- Badges aren't necessary, but using them is a simple way of letting other developers know that you know what you're doing.

Having this section can also be helpful to help link to important tools and also show some simple stats about your project like the number of forks, contributors, open issues etc...
Don't know where to get them from? Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. They have a ton of badges to help you get started. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

How one can contribute to the project -
This mostly will be useful if you are developing an open-source project that you will need other developers to contribute to. You will want to add guidelines to let them know how they can contribute to your project.

Also it is important to make sure that the licence you choose for an open-source projects is correct to avoid future conflicts. And adding contribution guidelines will play a big role.

Include Tests for the project -
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide code examples and how to run them.
This will help show that you are certain and confident that your project will work without any challenges, which will give other people confidence in it, too
